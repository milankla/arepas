# Summary Reporting Addition - Final Summary

## What Was Added

Added comprehensive summary reporting capabilities to `ConfigurableDataLoader`, matching the functionality in `data_loader.py`.

## New Code (61 lines)

### Two New Methods:

1. **`get_summary(data)`** (28 lines)
   - Returns detailed statistics as a dictionary
   - Calculates totals, coverage percentages, and averages
   - Provides per-dataset breakdowns
   - Suitable for programmatic access

2. **`print_summary(data)`** (33 lines)
   - Prints beautifully formatted summary to console
   - Includes emoji indicators (📊, ✅)
   - Shows per-dataset and overall statistics
   - Color-coded with loguru logger levels

## Updated Line Counts

| File | Before | After | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| `configurable_loader.py` | 282 | 343 | +61 lines |
| `load_config.py` | 103 | 103 | unchanged |
| **Total** | 385 | 446 | +61 lines |

## Features Added

### Summary Statistics Provided:

**Overall Metrics:**
- Total datasets loaded
- Total buildings across all datasets
- Buildings with images (and coverage %)
- Total images
- Average images per building

**Per-Dataset Metrics:**
- Buildings count
- Buildings with images (and coverage %)
- Total images
- Coverage percentage

### Example Output:

```
============================================================
DATA LOADING SUMMARY
============================================================

📊 Cole:
  Buildings: 1335
  Buildings with images: 1286 (96.3%)
  Total images: 4466

📊 Regis:
  Buildings: 1535
  Buildings with images: 1524 (99.3%)
  Total images: 6125

... (6 more datasets)

============================================================
✅ TOTAL: 8 datasets
   Buildings: 8208
   With images: 8074 (98.4%)
   Total images: 28543
   Avg images/building: 3.5
============================================================
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage:
```python
loader = ConfigurableDataLoader("config/data2.json")
data = loader.load_all_datasets()
loader.print_summary(data)  # Pretty formatted output
```

### Programmatic Access:
```python
summary = loader.get_summary(data)
print(f"Coverage: {summary['coverage_percentage']:.1f}%")
print(f"Total images: {summary['total_images']}")
```

### Works with All Loading Methods:
```python
# Load all
all_data = loader.load_all_datasets()
loader.print_summary(all_data)

# Load single neighborhood
cole = loader.load_neighborhood("Cole")
loader.print_summary({"Cole": cole})

# Load multiple neighborhoods
data = {
    "Cole": loader.load_neighborhood("Cole"),
    "Regis": loader.load_neighborhood("Regis"),
}
loader.print_summary(data)
```

## Demo Script

Created `scripts/demo_configurable_loader.py` (120 lines) that demonstrates:
- Loading all datasets with summary
- Loading single neighborhood with merging
- Accessing summary statistics programmatically
- Configuration info display

**Run it:**
```bash
python scripts/demo_configurable_loader.py
```

## Test Results

✅ Successfully tested on data2/ dataset:
- Loaded 8 datasets (6 neighborhoods)
- 8,208 buildings total
- 98.4% image coverage
- 28,543 total images
- 3.5 average images per building

## Benefits

1. **Feature Parity**: ConfigurableDataLoader now has same reporting as NeighborhoodDataLoader
2. **Better UX**: Beautiful formatted output with emoji and colors
3. **Flexibility**: Both visual and programmatic access to stats
4. **Completeness**: Calculates derived metrics (coverage %, averages)
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs in docs/SUMMARY_REPORTING.md

## Comparison with NeighborhoodDataLoader

| Aspect | NeighborhoodDataLoader | ConfigurableDataLoader |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Summary method** | ❌ (inline code) | ✅ `get_summary()` |
| **Pretty print** | ✅ Basic | ✅ Enhanced |
| **Coverage %** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Averages** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Programmatic** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Per-dataset** | ✅ | ✅ |
