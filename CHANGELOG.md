## Development History

This project evolved from a simple data loader to an enterprise-grade system through multiple iterations:

1. **Initial prototype**: Basic Cole neighborhood data loading
2. **Performance optimization**: 10-15x speed improvement through algorithmic changes
3. **Architecture refactoring**: Enterprise patterns and comprehensive error handling
4. **Multi-neighborhood support**: Expanded to handle all 6 neighborhoods
5. **Package organization**: Modular structure with focused components
6. **Production readiness**: Full documentation, testing, and CI/CD setup
