Project: Arepas
Purpose: Fine-tune an AI model (OpenAI Vision) to categorize historical architectural buildings based on multiple attributes. Each building will have multiple images and an attributes file for fine-tuning.

Instructions:
- Use Python as the main language.
- Focus on workflows for image and attribute file ingestion, preprocessing, and OpenAI Vision fine-tuning.
- Prioritize modular, well-documented code.
- Include placeholder code for model fine-tuning and data loading.
