Marranzino"	"Building Permit #1101"	"Alex N. Marranzino Incorporated"	"Assessor Record"	"In 1943, builder A. L. Marranzino was issued permit #1101 to build a brick masonry residence with a full basement at 2705 Steele Street. The “L” appears to be a typo as other records show that the house was built by Alexander “Alex” Nigio Marranzino. Alex was born in 1893 in Italy. He immigrated to the U.S. and moved to Denver as a boy. After serving in WWI, he returned to Denver and began working as a brick mason. By the 1930s, he was working as a building contractor. He and his wife Helen lived in northwest Denver. Marranzino built many homes throughout the city, including every house on the 2700 block of Steele Street.  In 1943, Alex sold 2705 Steele Street to Realty Mortgage and Investments Incorporated, starting a chain of short-term non-resident owners. Tenants included a clerk, registration officer, and U.S. Army Sergeant. In 1955, the house was purchased by Refugio C. and Rose Marie Baldivia. Refugio was born in 1925 in Iowa and living in Colorado by 1940. Rose was born in 1930 in Colorado. The couple raised four children in the house. Refugio served in the U.S. Army during World War II and won numerous awards for his service.  In Denver, he worked for the postal service as a mail carrier.  In 1978, Refugio and Rose Baldivia sold the house to Bob E. Hussey, starting another chain of short-term owners. In 1988, the house was purchased by Yvette Jeanice Freeman. She grew up in the Five Points neighborhood, the heart of Denver’s Black community, where her uncle owned a shoe and clothing store on Welton Street. In the 1990s, Yvette Freeman managed the Downtown Denver Business Improvement District as a senior strategist. Also in the 1990s, Freeman co-founded the Business Support Center, which was specifically designed to support long-time businesses, many Black-owned, along Welton Street. She currently works as a senior strategist for an urban planning consulting firm. It is unclear how long Freeman lived at 2705 Steele Street before she began renting it out."
