Colby"	"Assessor Record"	"In 1923, Colby Brothers was issued permit #1978 to build a residence at 3535 Elizabeth Street. The Colby brothers were Charles E. Colby and Willis W. Colby. After their parents moved the family to Denver in the 1870s, they began working in the brick industry, eventually opening their own brick manufacturing company called Colby Brothers. Their brick plant and yard was located on Albion Street between E. 32nd and E. 34th avenues. In 1926, the State Supreme Court upheld a decision by the City of Denver that denied the Colby Brothers permission to build a brick plant and yard at 34th and Dahlia.  In 1899, Charles and Willis Colby purchased a block of land in the Clayton neighborhood, which they platted as the Colby Subdivision in 1900. Permits reveal that between 1921 and 1923, Colby Brothers was issued permits to build five brick bungalows on the 3500 block of Elizabeth Street - 3515, 3521, 3535, 3545, and 3551. They had built 3529 Elizabeth Street a few years earlier, in 1917. On the 3500 block of Columbine Street between 1914 and 1921, Colby Brothers was issued permits for 3520, 3530, 3534, 3540, and 3562. From about 1900 until his death in 1933, Charles and his wife Orah and their daughter lived at 3563 Elizabeth Street, an older house on the block that was later converted to a church. Willis and his wife Jennie and children moved to 3520 Columbine Street after it was built in 1917.  In 1925, Charles Colby sold 3535 Elizabeth Street to Floyd T. and Margaret M. Jackson. Floyd and Margaret were from Craig, Colorado. They married in 1910, had a daughter named Margaret Jane, and lived in Utah for several years before settling in Denver. Floyd worked as a superintendent for the Leonard De Lue Detective Agency. He investigated crimes of forgery and fraud. Margaret worked as a teacher. After Floyd died in 1927, Margaret moved back to Craig and rented out 3535 Elizabeth Street. In 1939, she added her daughter Margaret Jane Jackson Stamm to the deed. Their tenants included an electroplater, clerk, and banker.  In 1945, Margaret Jackson and daughter Margaret Stamm sold the house to George and Mary Jane Ruff. George worked as a truck driver for a paving company. The couple had three daughters. The Ruff family alternated between residing in the house and renting it out.  In 1955, the Ruffs sold the house to Roy and Grace Kishiyama. Roy immigrated to the U.S. from Japan in 1915. He initially lived in Nebraska and worked as a farmer. Grace was born in Colorado and worked on the same farm in Nebraska. The couple moved to Colorado and married in 1930. They lived in Henderson, Colorado, and continued farming. In 1955, Roy and Grace moved into the house on Elizabeth Street with their children - Minoru Roy, James, Albert, Nancy, Jerry, and Shirley. As their children grew up and moved out, several made the news for accomplishments in their occupations and/or education. Grace Kishiyama died in 1983, and Roy sold the house the following year.  3535 Elizabeth Street was purchased by Charles E. Taylor in 1984, starting a chain of short-term owners who mostly rented out the property. Current owner Jonathan D. Sylvain purchased the house in 2005. He and his wife, Anh Ngo, also use the house as an investment property."

"1923, N/A"	"3535 Elizabeth Street is one of several houses built by Colby Brothers, a brick manufacturing company formed by brothers Charles E. Colby and Willis W. Colby. Their brick yard was located on Albion Street between E. 32nd and E. 34th avenues. In 1899/1900, they purchased an entire block and platted the Colby Subdivision. Between about 1914 and 1923, they built most houses on the 3500 block of Columbine Street (east side) and Elizabeth Street (west side). Both men lived in houses on the block with their families. Newspapers show that they were also issued permits for houses in other parts of town. More research is needed about the scale of their brick making operation and other properties they were involved in building in order to determine if this resource is recommended to be eligible under Criterion A for Community Planning & Development.  Research did not reveal any person or persons important to the past to be associated with this property, and it is recommended to be not eligible under Criterion B.  3535 Elizabeth Street is a great example of a brick bungalow built by Colby Brothers, a brick manufacturer who constructed most of the houses in the Colby Subdivision. Features include cottage windows and patterned brickwork, as well as an eyebrow porch roof and arched sunburst panel above the front entryway. There are no known alterations. This resource is recommended to be eligible under Criterion C.  This property has been subject to ongoing ground disturbance and it is highly unlikely that it will yield information important in prehistory or history and is not recommended to be eligible under Criterion D."
