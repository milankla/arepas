There is also a building behind the primary residence that may be a garage and/or shed. The assessor estimates the year of construction as 1942.    The ﬁrst known owners and residents of the property are Elwood and Gladys Cottrell. They were living on West Kentucky Avenue in 1942 but by 1943 they listed 855 South Knox as their residence. A permit could not be located, but the Cottrells likely built the house. Elwood was born in Nebraska and Gladys Fredonia Honeyﬁeld was born in New Mexico. Her ﬁrst husband, Ernest Mayhew, died in 1927. She had four young boys (Julius, Wilbur, Gilbert, George) when she married Elwood in 1928. The couple had three more children - Elwood Jr., and twins Charlene and Charles. Elwood Sr. served in World War I and worked as a cement ﬁnisher. Some of the sons also later worked as cement ﬁnishers. Julius, Wilbur, Gilbert, George, and Elwood Jr. were all married by the mid-1950s, and several of the newlywed couples listed 855 South Knox Court as their residence. Charlene married Russell Joseph VanCleave Jr. in 1956. Charles married Karen Raichart in 1964.     With almost a dozen members of the family (including young grandchildren) at times listing their address as 855 S. Knox Court in the late 1940s and 1950s, it is highly likely that some of the young families were actually living in the other small dwellings on the parcel. The date of construction for these buildings is unknown, although an aerial photograph circa 1942/1943, suggests they had not yet been built at that time. The ﬁrst separate listing is from 1954 with George and his wife Vergie living in “855 rear.” They are listed as living at 857 S. Knox starting in 1957. Charles and Karen listed their address as 3460 West Ada Place in 1968. It is unknown if this is an alternative address for 855 or 857, both of which front on W. Ada. Charlene’s daughter Donna VanCleave lived at 857 S. Knox in the early 1980s.   Elwood and Gladys lived together at 855 South Knox Court until their deaths in 1983 and 1981, respectively. Ownership of the house was transferred to Elwood Jr., Charles and Charlene in 1983. Although Charlene died in 1990 and Elwood Jr. died in 2013, they are still listed as co-owners of the property. Charles and Karen continue to reside at 855 South Knox Court. Charles Cottrell shared with the Discover Denver team that he has lived in the home his entire life and that it was built by his father with stone salvaged from either the Denver County jail (demolished 1963) or Arapahoe County Courthouse (demolished 1933). While interesting, this information could not be veriﬁed.

"c.1942"	"855 South Knox Court is not directly associated with significant events or patterns of events in history and is not recommended to be eligible under Criterion A.  Research did not reveal any person or persons important to the past to be associated with this property, and it is recommended to be not eligible under Criterion B.  855 South Knox Court is a good example of a rusticated stone residence, likely built by the owners around 1942. The current owner, who has lived in the home his entire life, states that the residence was built by his father with stone salvaged from either the Denver County Jail (demolished 1963) or Arapahoe County Courthouse (demolished 1933). While interesting, this information could not be verified. Based on an aerial photograph believed to be circa 1942/1943, the shed roof portion of the building on the west side appears to be original. Although the building appears to have good integrity overall and appears to have been owned by one family, more research is needed to determine how and when the structure was built.  This property has been subject to ongoing ground disturbance and It is highly unlikely that it will yield information important in prehistory or history and is not recommended to be eligible under Criterion D.
