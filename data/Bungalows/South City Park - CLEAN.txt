Ervin"	"Denver Assessor Records"	"Frank Ervin, a bookkeeper for the Denver Pressed Brick Company, is listed as owner on the 1908 building permit (#715) under which this home was built. No architect or builder is listed on the permit. Frank and his wife, Emma, lived in the home for the next several decades.  Frank C. Ervin was born in 1874 in Ohio, and married Emma Armstrong, born c.1880 in Colorado, in Denver in 1899. Within just a few years of moving into 1539 Madison Street, city directories list Frank as secretary and general manager of the Denver Pressed Brick Company. He was active in Denver business and trade associations, serving as president of the Colorado Clay Products Association in 1924. Frank, along with his brother William, were active in the Colorado Mountain Club. Ervin Peak, located in Summit County, is named after William, who climbed every peak in the United States over 14,000 feet.  Frank and Emma were a prominent Denver couple, often appearing in local newspapers for their social engagements. Frank died in 1932 and Emma continued to live in the house until 1957 when she passed away. Her mother, Mary Sella Armstrong, lived with her for a time during the early 1940s. Loren V. and Daisy T. Lowe bought the house in 1957. Loren was married several times, and ran a rooming house at 1040 Pennsylvania Street in the mid-1940s. He died in 1959, and Daisy remained in the Madison Street house until 1964.  During the 1960s, the house changed hands frequently and appears to have served as a rental property. City directories show that the home had a basement apartment; a separate entrance leading directly to the basement is visible from the front of the house. It is unknown whether this entrance was a later addition.  James W. Vinyard took possession of the house in 1972; he married Dorothy May Beardslee in 1979 and they lived in the home until 1996. James was originally from Texas and came to Colorado as a child to live with his maternal grandfather after his parents’ legal separation. His occupation in the 1970s was listed in city directories as a trust officer for a Denver bank. Dorothy was a middle school math teacher and developed a remedial math course that was adopted by a number of districts in Colorado; she died in 1995.  Christopher Garrity (sometimes listed as Gharrity) owned the home from 1997 to 2002. He was in the legal profession; it is unknown whether he lived in the house. Jason and Sara Dembeck owned the home from 2002 to 2020. Jason is co-owner of a real estate brokerage and Sara a nurse. A recent real estate listing shows that the home had been divided into at least three separate units.  The current owners of the home are Kimberley Rae and Brok McFerron."

The permit lists Smith as the building contractor. John was born about 1874 in Missouri. His wife Elta was born in Nebraska. They moved to Denver in the 1920s and John worked as a real estate agent. One of their two sons, Everett, lived in the house and worked with his father in real estate. An injury from his service in World War I appears to have contributed to Everett’s death by drowning in 1932. Elta’s parents, James and Maggie Gross, also lived in the house. After James died in 1933, the family began to rent out the basement as an apartment with a separate rear entrance. First tenants were a fireman and his wife.  Elta died in 1941, and John sold the house in 1944 to Fred R. and Ida M. Richards. They had recently moved to Colorado from Wyoming where Fred worked as a sheep rancher. In 1950, they sold the house to Julia A. Lehenbauer. Her husband George, a carpenter, died in 1951.  In 1958, Lehenbauer sold the house to Jacob and Alma Roth. Jacob was born in 1915 in Silt, Colorado. Alma was also born in Colorado. Jacob was a machinist for a manufacturer of irrigation pumps. Alma worked at a laundry. They had two children, Norma Jean and James Paul. It is unknown if they rented out the basement apartment. Jacob died in 1994.  In 1996, Alma sold the house to Janette Susan Friesen and Charles J. Cappleman. The house began to be listed with the address 3636 East 16th Avenue under their ownership. Janette and Charles lived in the house. It is unknown if they rented out one of the units, but records reveal that they owned multiple rental properties in Denver.  In 2002, Friesen sold the house to Michelle K. Smith and David I. F. Brown. David sold the house to current owner Garrett Joviak in 2021. Real estate listings suggest that the house has been a single-family residence since at least 2002."
